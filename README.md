# Data-Encryption-Tool
A simple data encryption tool that encrypts user input and stores it in an encrypted form in a SQLite database was created using C++ and SQLite.
By using a simple Caesar Cipher to encrypt the user input, this code opens a SQLite database file called "data.db," creates a table named "data" with two columns (id and "encrypted"), inserts the encrypted message into the database, retrieves the encrypted message from the database, and displays it to the user.Â
